# Update: photos.bradsiefert.com

Photography is a massive part of my life. I carry a camera with me to every significant event and I try to capture important, meaningful moments. A large percentage of them are family photos that I will never share publicly, but there are subjects I return to over and over again that make their way to my portfolio. I have photographed over 100 weddings and worked on a handful of commercial photoshoots, but those days are behind me now. Photography is a hobby and a passion for me now. 

For over 10 years my photography portfolio was a flat HTML/CSS/JS files with no frontend framework. It worked fine but recently I decided to level up and bring the site into the modern era. I transitioned it to Nuxt 4 but still kept the core Javascript written years and years ago because if it aint broke, why fix it? I added light/dark mode switching, CSS transitions, better image loading, and updated the content to better fit what I enjoy shooting.
