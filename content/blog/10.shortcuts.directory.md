Sometimes, you pick the wrong horse. Or, the wrong front-end framework. Early in my front-end development journey, I decided I was going to choose a VueJS framework and use it for a variety of projects. That's when I searched for and found [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org). It was exactly what I needed. 

When I had the idea for [shortcuts.directory](https://shortcuts.directory), I was excited to use Gridsome and really enjoyed using it to build the web app, connect it to my Airtable backend, and later post it to Product Hunt (it got over 500 likes!).

It took about a year, but eventually, I started to wonder if I'd chosen poorly. Releases grew very rare, which was odd for a framework that had been releasing multiple times a month. The last release to this date was v0.7.23 which was released on September 17th, 2019. Before long, I ran into issues arose that couldn't be fixed. An error with Gridsome and my host Netlify made it so I couldn't update the site anymore. I would have to migrate it 😞.

And then I found [Nuxt](http://nuxt.com). What Next.js is to React, Nuxt is to VueJS. It's fast, well maintained, and has a great community. I didn't have time to do a full migration to Nuxt, but I spun up a simple site and embedded an iframe of the Airtable database I used as a backend to the previous site. It will have to do for now. 

Maybe someday I'll do a v2.
