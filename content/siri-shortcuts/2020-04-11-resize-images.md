This shortcut resizes images to a set length to reduce size and set images to a particular size. Wait, aren't there lots of other Resize Image shortcuts? Why would I want this one? 2 reasons:

- ✅ This shortcut resizes the long edge of the image—not just the width like most resize shortcuts.
- ✅ You can resize multiple images with this shortcut, not just one.

The default size is 1200px, but you can easily change it to whatever you'd like. I hope you enjoy it. This was the first shortcut where I learned the "Repeat with Each" action so it'll always have a special place in my heart. ❤️
