I love the podcast player Overcast, and wish that most everyone used it, but many people still use Apple Podcasts and Spotify to listen to podcasts. I've found that it's very annoying to try and share a podcast link with non-Overcast users, so I made this shortcut to make it a bit easier. You must run this from the share sheet in Overcast. When prompted in Overcast, choose "Share Link" and the shortcut will give you do it give you an option to search either Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
