# photos.bradsiefert.com

2017 marked 10 years of taking photographs and I wanted to mark that time with a book. I laid out and printed 25 large photo books and distributed them among friends and family. Creating the book was a job, but I realized I wanted to create a web version that would be available for others to enjoy as well.

I orignally created the site using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), because it made it possible to flip through the site like a book. In preparation for building a 20 Year book (how is it possible it's time for that already?) I rebuilt the site using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), the most popular VueJS frontend framework. The majority of my websites are built using it and I've come to love building with it.

Check out the site to see my favorite images from my first decade of photography.
