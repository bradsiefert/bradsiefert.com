The stock market is a mystery to most of us. BLUECHXP is a gamified version of a stock market trading app called TopStepTrader, where the user doesn't have to put up any of their own money. Players can learn and play the stock market, and still have a chance to earn prizes and cash based on how well they do. 

The app tries to marry the stock market with the daily fantasy game play model and it presented many, many design challenges and changes throughout the life of the app.
