# Mentor Connect

I had the opportunity to design a mentor connection web app for entrepreneurs and advisors. The goal is that entrepreneurs would develop a crew of trusted advisors who would be on their board of connections. The platform organized meetings and reviews for entrepreneurs and advisors to ensure the quality and accountability of the people involved. I'm happy with the overall vibe of the app. I think it's light and playful in a way that I hope makes it so people engage in mutual learning.
