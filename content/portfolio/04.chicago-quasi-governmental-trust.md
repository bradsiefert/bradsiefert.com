Unfortunately, sometimes a logo, a branding idea and style hit the cutting room floor and that's what happened with this project. I live in Chicago and our city government doesn't have the best reputation for getting things done in the most timely, efficient, and cost effective manner. A trust was put together for private companies to help out with city projects, in mutually beneficially and cooperative way. I thought that this logo would highlight the Chicago flag and be balanced by a strong, workman-like typeface. Sadly, the client did not. Their loss is your visual gain.
