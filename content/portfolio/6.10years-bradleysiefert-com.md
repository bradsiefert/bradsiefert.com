# 10years.bradleysiefert.com

2017 marked 10 years of taking photographs and I wanted to mark that time with a book. I laid out and printed 25 large photo books (which were not cheap!) and distributed them among friends and family. I wanted to create a web version that would be available for others to enjoy as well.

This site is built using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), a javascript framework that helped make it easier to flip through the site like a book. Check it out to see some of my favorite images from my first decade of photography.
