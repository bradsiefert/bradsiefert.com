# Local Market

Local Market is an internal web app that allows a team to explore publications in their network and create hyper-local social media campaigns. There are several layers of difficulty from a user experience and technical perspective, but I'm happy with the solutions we were able to come up with. With this tool the team can search for publications that fit the campaign they are trying to fill and ensure that it will have enough reach for the platforms that are important to the brand.
