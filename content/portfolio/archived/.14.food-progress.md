# Food Progress
Food Progress is a web app that helps ensure food buyers are giving their population proper nutrition, while balancing costs. This internal app gives an operator the ability to balance cost, positive nutrients (like vitamins and fiber), and negative nutrients (like sodium and sugar) over a given menu. It was a really nice challenge to work through how to visualize and quantify what would be most important to the operator. Menus can
vary wildly, so it needed to be flexible enough to optimize each day with precision.
