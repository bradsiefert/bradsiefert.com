# GovOS Design System
In 2021, I joined GovOS as the companyâ€™s first in-house designer. They'd pieced design together for years through contractors and had no centralized visual design or design system. I was tasked to build a complete design system from scratch. I build foundations like color scale and typescale, 30+ components, and managed building the system in React.

## Problem & Need
GovOS delivers critical government services like records management, public records search, state and county tax payment, and short-term rental tax payment to hundreds of jurisdictions. It's products lacked any visual consistency, shared zero components or code, and federal/state web accessibility requirements had been ignored for many years. In my time at GovOS, I changed all of these things. Over my 2.5 years, I created a scalable design system that became the foundation for six major GovOS products and beyond.

The lack of a cohesive visual design and a design system created significant inefficiencies for both designers and engineers. There weren't any shared UI components or platform level code. Every new product or feature was effectively starting from scratch, which led to duplicated effort and inconsistent patterns. Designers had no shared library to work from, so visual styles varied widely between applications. Because front-ends were so brittle, developers rarely made visual updates. They didn't have any design assets to go off so when they made changes they hard-coded colors, spacing, and typography and never addressed the overall design debt resulting in fragmented user interfaces.
